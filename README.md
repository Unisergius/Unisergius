- 👋 Hi, I’m @Unisergius
- 👀 I’m interested in Information Technologies. As new technologies continue to arrive, I strive to keep me updated with code etiquette and new paradigms.
- 🌱 I’m currently into learning Startups and how ITs can be used to agilize and scale Startups.
- 💾 When it comes to technologies, I'm learning Laravel+Livewire, Javascript, Node, NestJS and Flutter.
- 🌍 I also create small networking events in my local IT community to offer networking and learning activities to anyone interested in.
- 🤩 Currently, I organize the local freecodecamp sessions in Algarve. I am also part of GDG Faro and Faro Flutter groups.
